# Assets for Cyberball Task

This task uses PsychoPy built-in stimuli (text/shape primitives) in config files.
No external media files are required for the current protocol implementation.

If future protocol revisions require external media, add only reference-aligned assets
and update `references/stimulus_mapping.md` accordingly.
